- ⚡ Fun fact: The world's first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace, not only wrote the first algorithm but also had an intriguing collaboration with Charles Babbage. She translated an article by Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea about Babbage's Analytical Engine and supplemented it with her own extensive notes. In her notes, she included what is now recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Despite the Analytical Engine never being completed, Lovelace's work laid the foundation for modern computer programming. So, in a way, she wasn't just the first programmer but also a pioneer of collaborative coding!
